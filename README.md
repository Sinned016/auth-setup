Using postgresSQL with NeonDB

Connecting to the database under server/index.tx.

Setting up drizze to work with my database in drizzle.config.ts.
Also created two new package.json paths "generate and push".

Setting up auth/login with Auth.js. In file "server/auth.ts".

And why auth schemas are in "server/schemas.ts".

When done with the project, make sure to do the entire server and auth setup again so I can REALLY learn it properly.
